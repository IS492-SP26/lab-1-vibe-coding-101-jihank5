Ping-Pong Game Comparison
=========================

After creating the ping pong game with Cursor, there are many details
that I believe were lacking. First of all, the ball was moving
incredibly slow. It took approximately 1 minute for the ball to move
from the right side to the left side. The readability of the code is
fairly easy; it consists mainly of functions and spaced well. The code
is not well commented; Cursor did not include any comments in the code.
The speed of generation was quick. It took 28.31 seconds for Cursor to
generate working code after I entered in the prompt. I believe Cursor to
be very user-friendly and I love the interface. It is easy to navigate
and straightforward. Because the original ping pong game was slow, I
prompted Cursor to make it faster and also add comments. It is easy to
allow for modifications, but I had to prompt Cursor twice to make it
faster. Honestly, I like Cursor better than VS Code because the agent
responds quickly and it is cleaner. When I clicked on the “Run” button,
the ping pong game instantly displayed on my screen. The agent included
information in the chat including the controls and how to run the
program. Also, the agent did a great job at explaining and displaying
the changes they were making.

There are many distinctions between the game that was created in Cursor
and the game that was created in VS Code. Compared to Cursor, VS Code
generated a ping pong game that was very fast. The speed in the VS Code
game was 5, and the speed in the Cursor game was 0.65. This version is
about 6.7x faster. Also, VS Code created the game with pygame. I didn’t
have pygame installed on my computer, so there was an error the first
time I ran the code. Afterwards, when I ran the code, the code ran in a
different application. The VS Code version had class functions and
comments, whereas the Cursor version did not have either of those. Next,
I think the agent is more readable in Cursor because there is a variety
of colors compared to VS Code. In addition, the agent in VS Code
generates more text in each response; I believe it drowns out the
information that the user might be looking for. In my opinion, Cursor
extracts only the important information. It is easy to debug with VS
Code because when the PyGame error displayed I asked the agent on how to
fix it and it gave me a solution right away. Additionally, VS Code takes
a bit more time to answer a prompt compared to Cursor. All in all, I
think Cursor generated a faster and more efficient game compared to VS
Code.
